# nilla-js
A small library of JS modules used to create page components on University of North Texas websites.
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>The purpose of this library is to provide a way to generate the HTML for various block and card level page components. Block-level components are added to the page using &lt;section&gt; tags; card-level components are added using &lt;article&gt; tags. Attributes are added using a specific list of data-* attributes. NillaJS processes these data-* attributes and outputs the raw HTML that can then be styled. Using this system provides consistent markup across all components allowing for easier long-term management of CSS and code.</p>
